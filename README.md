👋 **Hi there, I'm Raysa Rocha!** 👩‍💻

I recently completed my **Postgraduate Degree in Enterprise Data Science & Analytics** at **Nova IMS, Lisbon**. Coming from an engineering background, I have enthusiastically transitioned into Data Science & Analytics, developing expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Visualization and Data Engineering. I enjoy uncovering actionable insights and continuously enhancing my data skills. 🚀📊

### **Technical Skills** 💻
- **Programming & Machine Learning:** Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Power BI, Looker, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Databases:** SQL
- **Statistics & Analytics:** Regression, statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure (basic familiarity)

### **Projects Developed** 📂

#### **Individual Project**
- **Python Basics and K-Means Construction**
  - Learned foundational Python skills and implemented K-Means clustering algorithm for data segmentation.
 
- **BigQuery SQL Portfolio – Stack Overflow Dataset**
  - Built a complete SQL project from scratch using Google BigQuery and the Stack Overflow public dataset.
  - Practiced real-world querying techniques including filtering, aggregation, JOINs, CTEs, and window functions.
  - Organized the project into structured .sql files (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced) and documented datasets used.

#### **Group Projects**
- **Deep Learning – House Room Classifier**  
  - Developed deep learning models (CNN, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, ResNet101) to classify room images, achieving 87% accuracy with balanced F1-score.

- **Machine Learning – Employee Attrition Prediction**  
  - Built predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to identify key factors affecting employee retention.

- **Machine Learning – Customer Purchase Prediction**  
  - Created predictive models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVC, Neural Networks) to forecast customer buying behavior from survey data.

- **Machine Learning – Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**  
  - Implemented K-Means clustering to segment customers by demographics, spending patterns, and engagement.

- **Python & Clustering – Airbnb Listings Analysis**  
  - Performed exploratory data analysis, identifying clusters of Airbnb listings based on pricing and location.

- **Statistics – Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health**  
  - Conducted statistical analyses on survey data to evaluate remote work's impact on mental health.

- **SQL – Online Auction System for Inventory Management**  
  - Developed and optimized database schema, queries, and triggers for managing online auctions efficiently.

- **Big Data Foundations – MovieLens Dataset Analysis**  
  - Analyzed a large-scale movie ratings dataset (32M+ ratings) using Big Data tools.

- **Power BI – MovieLens Dataset Analysis**  
  - Designed interactive Power BI dashboards to effectively visualize and analyze user preferences and trends.

- **NoSQL Challenges (Azure)**  
  - Managed data using Cosmos DB Table API, MongoDB, and Cassandra.
