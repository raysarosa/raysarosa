### Hi there ðŸ˜€

I'm Raysa from Brazil (also half Portuguese) and I'm currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Enterprise Data Science & Analytics at Nova IMS. 
Transitioning from engineering, I'm discovering a new passion in data science and enjoying every moment of it. So far, Iâ€™ve worked on exciting projects involving Python, Machine Learning, SQL, and NoSQL. ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
