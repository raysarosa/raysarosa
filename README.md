### Hi there ðŸ˜€

I'm Raysa (brazilian and portuguese) and I'm currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in __Enterprise Data Science & Analytics__ at Nova IMS, Lisbon. 
Transitioning from engineering, I'm discovering a new passion in data science and enjoying every moment of it. So far, Iâ€™ve worked on exciting projects involving Python, Machine Learning, SQL, and NoSQL. ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
